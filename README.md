# Banking Analytics

_Banking Analytics_ is a data-driven analytics toolkit designed for banking and financial data exploration, visualization, and insight generation. This project empowers data analysts to efficiently ingest, clean, analyze, and visualize banking data to uncover business trends, customer behaviors, risks, and opportunities.

## Overview

As a data analyst, you will be able to:

- Rapidly import and explore raw transaction and customer datasets.
- Apply robust data cleaning and transformation pipelines using Python and SQL.
- Build and customize interactive dashboards (Power BI) to surface actionable insights.
- Generate automated reports and visualizations for stakeholders.
- Identify trends, anomalies, and business risks to support data-driven decision making.

## Key Features

- **Data Ingestion:** Easily load data from CSV, Excel, or SQL databases.
- **Data Cleaning:** Prebuilt scripts for handling missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Leverage Python notebooks for statistical summaries and visual exploration (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
- **Segmentation & Profiling:** Analyze customer segments by demographics, product usage, and risk profiles.
- **Transaction Analysis:** Time series and aggregation tools for transaction trends and pattern recognition.
- **Risk & Fraud Detection:** Templates for anomaly detection and risk scoring.
- **Custom Dashboards:** Power BI dashboards for sharing insights across teams.
- **Reporting:** Export insights and charts to CSV, PDF, or PowerPoint for business presentations.

## Typical Analyst Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition:**  
   Place raw data files in the `/data` directory or connect to your SQL database.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**  
   Run the cleaning scripts in `notebooks/` to preprocess and validate your data.
3. **Exploratory Analysis:**  
   Use the EDA notebooks to generate summary statistics, distributions, and initial findings.
4. **Deep-Dive Analytics:**  
   Apply segmentation, cohort analysis, or risk models as needed.
5. **Visualization & Reporting:**  
   Build dashboards in Power BI or export charts directly from notebooks for your reports.

## Technologies Used

- Python: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and prototyping
- SQL for querying and transformations
- Power BI for dashboarding and reporting

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohamednowfil/Banking-Analytics-.git
   cd Banking-Analytics-
   ```

2. **Set up your Python environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare your data:**
   - Place your CSV/Excel files in the `data/` folder, or
   - Configure your database connection in `.env` or the config file.

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebooks:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   - Open the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory and follow the steps for data cleaning, EDA, and analysis.

5. **Power BI Dashboards:**
   - Open the `.pbix` files in Power BI Desktop to explore or modify dashboards.
   - Connect Power BI to your processed data for dynamic updates.

## Example Use Cases

- **Product Managers:** Track customer adoption of new banking features.
- **Risk Analysts:** Monitor suspicious transactions and flag high-risk accounts.
- **Business Analysts:** Identify customer segments for targeted marketing.
- **Executives:** Visualize business KPIs and quarterly trends.
